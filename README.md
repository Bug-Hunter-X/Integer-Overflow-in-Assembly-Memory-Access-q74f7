# Integer Overflow Vulnerability in Assembly

This repository demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability in a simple assembly code snippet.  The vulnerability arises from the lack of bounds checking on the `ecx` register, which is used to calculate a memory address.  A large `ecx` value could lead to an overflow, causing the program to access memory outside its allocated space, potentially leading to a crash or security exploit.

## Vulnerability Details

The vulnerable line of code is:

`mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]`

This instruction attempts to read a value from memory at the address calculated as `ebx + ecx * 4`.  If `ecx` is excessively large, the addition could overflow, resulting in an invalid memory address.  This is especially dangerous if `ecx` is controlled by external input, as an attacker could manipulate it to trigger a buffer overflow vulnerability.

## Mitigation

The vulnerability can be mitigated by adding appropriate bounds checking to ensure that `ecx` remains within a safe range.  This could involve checking the value of `ecx` before performing the memory access or using a safer method of address calculation that handles potential overflows gracefully.
